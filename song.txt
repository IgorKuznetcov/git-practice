I been tryna call
I been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe

I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby



No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
